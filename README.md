# github-notes

## i. Git
* A piece of sofware that allows for the automatic tracking saving of files and their history without the need to manually add changes to a file through your file history. This process is called version control because of its automatic tracking of version history on a file.
* **HOWEVER**, thats not the only reason why its helpful. It can also play a large role in collaboration between people on one file which can help in making a task much more easier to acomplish.
  * Its important to note that git and github act as two different parts within a software.
  * Git acts as the version control software/the application of the website github.
  * can be run anywhere in all devices and locations 

## ii. Github 
* Github acts as the whole website service which basically hides the main structure of the git and is more of the interactive section with group members to create projects and code. 

## iii. Repo/Repository 
* A Repo/Repository acts as basically a multiple or group of files combined into one. 

## iv. commit 
* Commit acts as a **save button** basically creating a new file automatically when pressing the commit button
  
  * To implement changes that you may have forgotten to add, on github press the edit button/the pencil icon which will allow you to make changes and commit/create a new file.
    
    * Another thing to note is that you can also add **notes and descriptions** before you commit which can be helpful working as a group as       you can inform others what changes you made or just to keep track of things you add
      
**_"Commit hash"_**
