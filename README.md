## i. Git
* A piece of sofware that allows for the **automatic tracking**, saving of files and their history without the need to manually add changes to a file through your file history. This process is called **version control** because of its automatic tracking of version history on a file.
  
* **HOWEVER**, thats not the only reason why its helpful. It can also play a large role in collaboration between people on one file which can help in making a task much more easier to acomplish.
  
* Its important to note that git and github act as two different parts within github however they both share the purpose in acting as a social software allowing for group projects within files made through the git. 
    
  * Git acts as the version control **software/the application** of the website github.
    
  * can be run anywhere in all devices and locations 

## ii. Github 
* Github acts as the **whole website service** which basically hides the main structure of the git and is more of the interactive section with group members to create projects and code.
  
 * parts of the service that constitute as a service are signing in, commiting changes, and the repository. 

## iii. Repo/Repository 
* A Repo/Repository acts as basically a multiple or group of files **combined** into one.
  
 * Repositories can include descriptions and README.md's which act as basically adding context to a user as to what their project is about.
 * To create a repository click on "new repository" and select the name of the project, include a description/OPTIONAL, toggling the            README.md/OPTIONAL, and setting the repository to public or private. 

## iv. commit 
* Commit acts as a **save button** basically creating a new file **automatically** when pressing the commit button
  
 * To implement changes that you may have forgotten to add, on github press the edit button/the pencil icon which will allow you to make        changes and commit/create a new file.
    
 * Another thing to note is that you can also add **notes and descriptions** before you commit which can be helpful working as a group as       you can inform others what changes you made or just to keep track of things you add
      
**_"Commit hash"_**
* Is another part of the commit button
  
* How it works is that when you commit a commit hash will release basically an id every time the file saves providing each file with its own id and commit hash.
